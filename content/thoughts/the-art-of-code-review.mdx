Code review is more than just finding bugs. It's an opportunity for knowledge sharing, mentorship, and building a stronger team.

## Being a Good Reviewer

Focus on the important things. Don't nitpick style issues that should be handled by automated tools. Ask questions instead of making demands.

### What to Look For

- **Logic errors** - Does the code do what it's supposed to?
- **Edge cases** - What happens with unexpected input?
- **Security** - Are there any vulnerabilities?
- **Performance** - Will this scale?
- **Readability** - Can others understand this code?

### How to Give Feedback

Instead of:
> This is wrong. Use a Map here.

Try:
> Have you considered using a Map here? It might give us O(1) lookups instead of O(n).

## Receiving Feedback Gracefully

Remember that feedback is about the code, not about you. Every piece of feedback is an opportunity to learn and improve.

### Tips for Receiving Reviews

1. **Assume good intent** - Reviewers want to help
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - If feedback is unclear, ask
3. **Explain your reasoning** - Help reviewers understand your choices
4. **Thank your reviewers** - Their time is valuable

## Creating a Positive Culture

The tone of code reviews sets the culture of your engineering team. Lead by example with constructive, respectful feedback.

> Be kind. Be specific. Be helpful.

### Signs of a Healthy Review Culture

- Reviews happen quickly (< 24 hours)
- Comments are constructive and specific
- Knowledge is shared freely
- Everyone feels comfortable asking questions
- Praise is given alongside criticism

Code review is a skill that improves with practice. Invest in it, and your entire team will benefit.
