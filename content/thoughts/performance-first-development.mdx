Performance isn't something you can bolt on at the end of a project. It needs to be considered from day one.

## Measuring What Matters

Core Web Vitals have given us standardized metrics to measure user experience. Understanding these is crucial for modern web development.

### The Core Metrics

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** - How quickly the main content loads
- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint)** - How responsive the page feels
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** - Visual stability of the page

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|--------|------|-------------------|------|
| LCP | ≤2.5s | ≤4.0s | >4.0s |
| INP | ≤200ms | ≤500ms | >500ms |
| CLS | ≤0.1 | ≤0.25 | >0.25 |

## Building Performance into Your Workflow

From code review checklists to automated performance budgets, there are many ways to make performance a natural part of your development process.

### Performance Budget Example

```javascript
// performance-budget.json
{
  "bundles": {
    "main": "150kb",
    "vendor": "100kb"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "lcp": "2500ms",
    "cls": "0.1"
  }
}
```

### Code Review Checklist

Before merging any PR, ask:

1. Are images optimized and properly sized?
2. Is JavaScript being loaded efficiently?
3. Are we avoiding layout shifts?
4. Have we tested on slow connections?

## The Business Case

Performance directly impacts business metrics. The data is clear:

- **53%** of mobile users abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load
- **1 second** delay in page response can result in 7% reduction in conversions
- Google uses page experience as a ranking factor

> Performance is not just a technical concern—it's a business imperative.

Investing in performance pays dividends in user satisfaction, conversion rates, and search rankings.
