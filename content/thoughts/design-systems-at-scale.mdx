Building a design system is one thing. Maintaining it across multiple products and teams is another challenge entirely.

## The Foundation

A successful design system starts with clear principles and a solid foundation of tokens, components, and patterns that can scale with your organization.

### Design Tokens

Design tokens are the atoms of your design system. They include:

- **Colors** - Primary, secondary, semantic colors
- **Typography** - Font families, sizes, weights, line heights
- **Spacing** - Consistent spacing scale
- **Shadows** - Elevation levels
- **Border radii** - Consistent rounding

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #0066cc;
  --spacing-md: 16px;
  --radius-lg: 12px;
}
```

## Governance and Contribution

Establishing clear governance models and contribution guidelines ensures the system grows in a sustainable way while remaining consistent.

### The RFC Process

For any significant change, we use a Request for Comments (RFC) process:

1. **Proposal** - Author describes the change and rationale
2. **Discussion** - Team provides feedback
3. **Decision** - Maintainers approve or request changes
4. **Implementation** - Change is built and documented

## Adoption Strategies

Getting teams to adopt your design system requires more than just good documentation. It requires building relationships and demonstrating value.

> A design system is only as good as its adoption rate. The best system in the world is worthless if nobody uses it.

### Keys to Successful Adoption

- **Start with quick wins** - Help teams solve immediate problems
- **Provide migration paths** - Don't require big-bang rewrites
- **Celebrate adopters** - Showcase teams using the system well
- **Listen to feedback** - Iterate based on real usage

The goal is to make using the design system the path of least resistance.
